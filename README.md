# temporary-code
An ongoing and provisional collection of code I'm writing mostly for fun. Some personal explorations with the sole aim of understanding existing algorithms, learning their logics or write new ones and sometimes teaching them in some computational design courses. A repository for imperfect #gh3d definitions maybe someone out there will find useful.
